The 911 system was designed to provide a universal, easy-to-remember number for people to reach police, fire or emergency medical assistance from any phone in any location, without having to look up specific phone numbers. Today, people communicate in ways that the designers of the original 911 system could not have envisioned: wireless phones, text and video messages, social media, Internet Protocol (IP)-enabled devices, and more.
